# Me in a nutshell

## *Hung Dinh*

Hi there,

I am Hung, a geophysicist with a strong interest to apply data science and machine learning skills into solving geoscience problems.

I used to work in the Oil and Gas industry as a seismic attribute analyst for 3 years before pursuing a graduate study program in Canada in 2012. In 2017, during my internship, I met a genius mathematician named Anton. After reviewing my neural network to predict hydrocarbon reservoir properties, he suggested me take some advanced courses about Machine Learning. That moment changed my view of knowledge.

In October 2017, I completed my first Machine learning course by Stanford University on Coursera. I found it beautiful, and decided to take a more comprehensive specialization: Deep learning by deeplearning.ai. During that time I took other two Data science specializations by Johns Hopkins University and IBM as side projects to practice. With my strong background in computation and programming, the three specializations were useful and quite capable to achieve. In the summer 2018 I finished them and at the end of the year, got my PhD degree in Geophysics.

I left Canada and started working as a seismic processing geophysicist in the UK in April 2019. Working with industrial big data, I found this the excellent place for Data science skills and Machine learning knowledge. In the first year, I have successfully established a currently-patent-pending unsupervised machine learning method to quality control full waveform inversion, a method to estimate velocity of the subsurface rock. I also proved that machine learning can produce a good initial starting point before the inversion estimation. In the evening, I still pursuing Data sicence courses by the University of Michigan. I am now at the last course of the specialization, am exposed to variety fields in the integrated Data science - Machine learning world.

If you are reading this, you have probably seen my other portfolio page at https://rpubs.com/nhohung/portfolio. At that time, I had some fancy projects/apps in R that were deployed on RPubs. Now I have ported them some of them to python and transferred them to Github. They are reworded and explained in more detailed. On this page, I would like to introduce some of my key projects on data science and applied machine learning.

Cheers,
Hung


## Analysis on Air quality index in Hue, Vietnam (May 2020)
In this project, I worked on time series Air quality index data acquired in Vietnam to answer common myths about air quality and human activities. I carried out exploratory analysis and performed simple linear regression to quantify my conclusions.

## Analysis on Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) in the world (April 2020)
In this project I have analyzed the growing trend of the pandemic in some selected countries. Skills in data domain conversion and web scraping have been demonstrated to obtain a meaningful comparison between countries. I have also built an interactive map illustrating current situation of COVID cases in the world.

## City livability clustering (February 2020)
In this project I clustered the most 358 popular cities in the world based on the similarity in living condition. The similarity is measured based on 6 main living indexes, including crime, health, culture, nature, education, and infrastructure. Three main city groups are determined associating to living, working and resting conditions.

## Weather forecast (May 2019)
This is a small web app showing weather forecast for my 2 interested cities: Hanoi (Vietnam) and Crawley (UK). Hanoi is where my family live, and Cralwey is my resident city. The app involves collecting, organizing and graphing the json files returned from api calls to a preferred weather provider. It is made to display on phone screens with minimalistic but informative style. Try it out here:

## The text predictor (June 2018)
This is a Data science project where I knew nothing NLP topic and literature material: build the next-word predictor when the user starts with some words. You must be familiar with this function as it is integrated into the virtual keyboard on the phone you use every day. However, implementing it is so challenging. I did a research on the topic of Natural language processing, how to do it, and how to optimize it. Please give it a try here:

And also, I recommend having a look at what behind the scene: the processing part (http://rpubs.com/nhohung/NLP_processing) and the prediction model (http://rpubs.com/nhohung/NLP_prediction).

## Body movement predictor (October 2018)
In this project, I got to use a machine learning method to predict the type of movement that a volunteer is exercising based on data collected from sensors attached to his body. When reading about how the data is acquired, and where the sensors are positioned, I think it is an easy task, because intuitively some movements would be separated from others simply by the differences of sensor placement. However, a quick exploratory analysis has killed all my hope, and I have to do a more sophisticated classification to solve it. See how I tackle the problem here:

## Analyzing the natural disaster impact on human (April 2018)
This project is a typical example of what data science involves: data cleaning. I was provided a real-life dataset which lists the cost/damage of different types of natural catastrophe on human lives and economy and was asked to summarize which type causes the most damage to human. The task sounds simple enough, except a problem that the inputs are heavily contaminated by errors: typo, duplication, and poor categorization. I got to reprocess the whole data before sorting them out. Find the details how I reproduce the process here:
