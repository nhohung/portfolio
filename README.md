# Me in a nutshell

## *Hung Dinh*

Hi there,

I am Hung, a geophysicist with a strong interest to apply data science and machine learning skills into solving geoscience problems.

By 2012, I have worked in the Oil and Gas industry as a seismic attribute analyst for 3 years before pursuing a graduate degree in Canada. During this program, I met a genius mathematician Anton Biryukov. After a project using neural network predict hydrocarbon reservoir properties, he suggested me to take some advanced courses about Machine Learning. That opened an entire new horizon to my knowledge.

In October 2017, I completed my first Machine learning course by Stanford University on Coursera. I found the math beautiful, and decided to take a more comprehensive deep learning specialization by Deeplearning.ai. I also took the first two Data science specializations by Johns Hopkins University and IBM. They turned out to excellent side projects to apply machine learning theories. Surprisingly, programming and analytic skills I had gained during my study were extremely helpful in achieving these courses. In late 2018 I finished all of them and got my PhD degree in Geophysics at the same time.

I left Canada and started working as a seismic processing geophysicist in the UK in spring 2019. Working with industrial big data, I found this the excellent place for Data science skills and Machine learning knowledge. It become a daily practice to use them to ease data preparation, automate tasks and create new tools for my work. In the first year, I have successfully established an unsupervised machine learning method (currently patent pending) to quality control full waveform inversion, aka "FWI" - a geophysical technique to estimate velocity of the subsurface rock. Developing from my work experience before, I proved that machine learning can produce a good initial starting point before the inversion estimation.

I kept pursuing Data sicence courses by the University of Michigan in the eveneing. This is a much more challenging specialization than the others I took earlier. I completed it in late summer 2020. Some people are not interested in taking similar Data sicence courses, but to me they always contain new knowledge, and especially give different real world problems for me to practice.

If you are reading this, you have probably seen my other portfolio page at https://rpubs.com/nhohung/portfolio. At that time, I had some fancy projects/apps in R that were deployed on RPubs. I have ported them to python and transferred to my Github page. They are reworded and explained in more detailed. On this page, I would like to introduce some of my key projects on data science and applied machine learning.

Cheers,
Hung


## Analysis on Air quality index in Hue, Vietnam (May 2020)
In this project, I worked on time series Air quality index data acquired in Vietnam to answer common myths about air quality and human activities. I carried out exploratory analysis and performed simple linear regression to quantify my conclusions.

## Analysis on COVID-19 in the world (April 2020)
In this project I have analyzed the growing trend of the pandemic in some selected countries. Skills in data domain conversion and web scraping have been demonstrated to obtain a meaningful comparison between countries. I have also built an interactive map illustrating the current situation of COVID cases in the world.

## City livability clustering (February 2020)
In this project I clustered the most 358 popular cities in the world based on the similarity in living conditions. The similarity is measured based on six main living indexes, including crime, health, culture, nature, education, and infrastructure. Three main city groups are determined associating to living, working and resting conditions.

## Weather forecast (May 2019)
This is a small web app showing weather forecast for my 2 interested cities: Hanoi (Vietnam) and Crawley (UK). Hanoi is where my family live, and Cralwey is my resident city. The app involves collecting, organizing and graphing the json files returned from api calls to preferred weather providers. It is made to display on phone screens with minimalistic but informative style. Try it out here:

## The text predictor (June 2018)
This is a Data science project on NLP topic where I learned literature materials from zero: build the next-word predictor when the user starts with some words. You must be familiar with this function as it is integrated into the virtual keyboard on the phone you use every day. Implementing it is challenging though. I did a research on the topic of Natural language processing, how to do it, and how to optimize it. Please give it a try here:

And also, I recommend having a look at what behind the scene: the processing part (http://rpubs.com/nhohung/NLP_processing) and the prediction model (http://rpubs.com/nhohung/NLP_prediction).

## Body movement predictor (October 2018)
In this project, I got to use a machine learning method to predict the type of movement that a volunteer is exercising based on data collected from sensors attached to his body. When reading about how the data is acquired, and where the sensors are positioned, I think it is an easy task, because intuitively some movements would be separated from others simply by the differences of sensor placement. However, a quick exploratory analysis has killed all my hope, and I have to do a more sophisticated classification to solve it. See how I tackle the problem here:

## Analyzing the natural disaster impact on human (April 2018)
This project is a typical example of what data science involves: data cleaning. I was provided a real-life dataset which lists the cost/damage of different types of natural catastrophe on human lives and economy and was asked to summarize which type causes the most damage to human. The task sounds simple enough, except a problem that the inputs are heavily contaminated by errors: typo, duplication, and poor categorization. I got to reprocess the whole data before sorting them out. Find the details how I reproduce the process here:
